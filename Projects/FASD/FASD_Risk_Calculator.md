# Prenatal Risk Assessment Tool for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder
**Project Lead:** Annie Xinyi Luo 
**Timeline:** September 2025 – December 2025

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focused on clinical tool development, specifically creating a weighted scoring model for prenatal FASD risk assessment while maintaining high standards of data security.

## 🛠️ Technical Solution
* **Algorithm Engineering:** Translated complex clinical guidelines into a weighted scoring algorithm and functional data model with one-decimal precision.
* **Security & Privacy:** Engineered a password protection system and restricted data processing to **local-only environments** to prevent potential data breaches.
* **Data Integrity:** Developed **automated input verification** to ensure data consistency and prevent errors caused by missing clinical information.

## 💡 Impact
* Delivered a high-precision tool for reliable FASD risk evaluation.
* Established a privacy-first framework for handling sensitive prenatal information.
