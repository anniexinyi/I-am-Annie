Healthcare Executive Dashboard
Project Lead | Jan 2025 – May 2025
📌 Background & Challenge
Hospital administrators often face "data overload," where vast amounts of clinical and operational data exist but are not easily interpretable for quick decision-making. This project aimed to bridge the gap between raw backend data and executive-level strategy.

🛠️ The Technical Solution

System Architecture: Used draw.io to design and construct the layout of the healthcare dashboard specifically for executive use.

Data Pipeline: Leveraged SQL and Excel to generate, clean, and load complex clinical datasets, ensuring 100% data integrity throughout the process.

Visualization: Built an interactive interface using Python (Matplotlib and Plotly) to help healthcare leaders interpret hospital performance trends.

💡 Key Deliverables

Performance Monitoring: Interactive views that allow for real-time interpretation of hospital metrics.

Data Accuracy: A robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process that standardized disparate clinical data points.
