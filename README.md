1. Healthcare Executive Dashboard
Project Lead | Jan 2025 – May 2025
📌 Background & Challenge
Hospital administrators often face "data overload," where vast amounts of clinical and operational data exist but are not easily interpretable for quick decision-making. This project aimed to bridge the gap between raw backend data and executive-level strategy.

🛠️ The Technical Solution

System Architecture: Used draw.io to design and construct the layout of the healthcare dashboard specifically for executive use.


Data Pipeline: Leveraged SQL and Excel to generate, clean, and load complex clinical datasets, ensuring 100% data integrity throughout the process.


Visualization: Built an interactive interface using Python (Matplotlib and Plotly) to help healthcare leaders interpret hospital performance trends.

💡 Key Deliverables

Performance Monitoring: Interactive views that allow for real-time interpretation of hospital metrics.


Data Accuracy: A robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process that standardized disparate clinical data points.

2. Retrospective Study on Tobacco Use Trends
Project Lead | Sept 2024 – Dec 2024
📌 Background & Challenge
Understanding longitudinal trends in adolescent tobacco use is critical for public health policy. This study analyzed massive datasets to identify shifts in usage patterns among U.S. students across a seven-year period.

🛠️ The Technical Solution

Statistical Analysis: Analyzed 2010–2017 tobacco use trends among U.S. students using a retrospective SPSS study.


Advanced Testing: Applied rigorous inferential statistical analyses, including Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests and one-way ANOVA, to identify significant variances in the data.

💡 Key Deliverables

Trend Identification: Successfully mapped the trajectory of tobacco use across middle and high school cohorts over nearly a decade.


Methodological Rigor: Ensured findings were statistically sound through non-parametric and parametric testing.

3. Prenatal Risk Assessment Tool (FASD)
Project Lead | Sept 2025 – Dec 2025
📌 Background & Challenge
Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) requires early and accurate risk assessment. The challenge was to create a digital tool that could calculate risks based on complex clinical guidelines while strictly adhering to data privacy standards.

🛠️ The Technical Solution

Algorithm Development: Translated medical guidelines into a weighted scoring algorithm and functional data model with one-decimal precision.


Security Protocols: Implemented a password protection system and restricted data processing to local-only environments to prevent data breaches.


Error Prevention: Engineered automated input verification systems to maintain data consistency and mitigate errors caused by missing clinical information.

💡 Key Deliverables

Privacy-First Design: A tool that prioritizes patient confidentiality through local processing and security barriers.


Reliable Assessment: A high-precision data model for consistent FASD risk evaluation.

4. Nursing Documentation Optimization & AI Care Plans
Project Lead | Sept 2025 – Dec 2025
📌 Background & Challenge
Clinical burnout is often driven by the documentation burden. This project sought to redesign the documentation workflow to improve both clinician satisfaction and patient outcomes.

🛠️ The Technical Solution

UX Research: Conducted semi-structured interviews and utilized affinity walls to identify systemic bottlenecks impacting the quality of patient care.


AI Proposal: Proposed an AI-assisted care plan solution based on evidence-based literature reviews to significantly reduce documentation time.


Workflow Optimization: Designed technical recommendations that maintain 100% clinician control and decision-making authority.

💡 Key Deliverables

Stakeholder Insights: Qualitative data from clinicians used to drive technical recommendations.


Strategic Blueprint: A recommendation for integrating AI into nursing workflows without sacrificing clinical oversight.
